          <p>The conquest of space was first mentioned during the Cold War. It is a war of ideology that is characterized by the bipolar division of the world, between the East dominated by the Soviet Union, socialist, and the West dominated by the United States, capitalist. The protective « glacis » demanded by Stalin in 1945 greatly accelerated the formation of the « Great Two ». During the conflict between the western bloc and the communist bloc, the world was never so close to a third world war, mainly in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. However, the fear of a World War III fuels the desire to remove tensions, which brings about a relaxation.</p>

            <p>The West founds NATO, while the East forms the Warsaw Pact.
The West defends capitalism and Western democracy, while the East defends socialism and the so - called « popular » democracy.
The West is based on private property and defends the Marshall Plan, while the East creates COMECON and advocates the socialist regime</p>

        <h3>From 1957 to 1975...</h3>
        <p>The conquest of space was a major issue of the Cold War. It is the ground of a fierce technological competition between the USSR and the United States where each one tries to demonstrate its superiority. Beginning in 1957 with Sputnik-1, the first man-made satellite in history launched by the USSR, it soon became the subject of manned flights and the sending of a man to the Moon.
            
            On April 12, 1961, the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1.[58] They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as « sailor of the universe ».</p>
